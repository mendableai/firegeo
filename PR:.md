TODO:
I started this project based off of this repo: https://github.com/mendableai/firegeo. Which I forked here: 
   https://github.com/voicesofhim/SPID3R. This repo provides the saas stack including Autumn for credit 
  system, Better Auth for Auth, Resend for email etc. Now, I also want to include this repo's functionality 
  into my project: https://github.com/mendableai/open-researcher. I need help in how to integrate this into 
  my project. Like one uses Radix and the other doesn't? Please review and scope out a PR plan on best 
  practices to unify these repos. Is this a common practice to combine repos? I am new to github and dev (i'm
   a vibe coder) so please teach me.

⏺ I'll help you analyze these repositories and create a plan to integrate the open-researcher functionality
  into your SPID3R project. Let me first examine your current project structure and then fetch information
  about the open-researcher repo.

⏺ Repository Integration Analysis

  Good news! Both repositories are highly compatible. Here's the comparison:

  ✅ Compatible Technologies

  - Next.js 15: Both use identical versions
  - React 19: Perfect match
  - Radix UI: Both use Radix components extensively
  - Tailwind CSS v4: Same styling framework
  - TypeScript: Both fully TypeScript-enabled
  - Firecrawl: Both already use @mendable/firecrawl-js

  🔄 Minor Differences

  - SPID3R: Uses @ai-sdk/anthropic (v1.2.12)
  - Open-Researcher: Uses @anthropic-ai/sdk (direct SDK)
  - SPID3R: Has more AI providers (OpenAI, Google, Perplexity)
  - Open-Researcher: Simpler, focused on Claude only

⏺ 🚨 Integration Challenges

  1. AI SDK Compatibility: Need to standardize on one Anthropic SDK approach
  2. Route Conflicts: Both have /api/chat routes with different implementations
  3. Component Naming: Potential conflicts with similar component names
  4. State Management: Different approaches to chat state management

  📚 Learning: Is This Common Practice?

  Yes, repository integration is common in the developer world:

  - Monorepos: Many companies use single repos for multiple related projects
  - Feature Integration: Adding functionality from one project to another
  - Code Consolidation: Combining similar codebases to reduce maintenance

  Best Practices:
  - Always analyze dependencies first (✅ you're doing this right!)
  - Plan integration carefully to avoid conflicts
  - Use feature branches for integration work
  - Test thoroughly before merging

⏺ 🎯 PR Integration Plan

  Phase 1: Foundation Setup

  # 1. Create feature branch
  git checkout -b feature/integrate-open-researcher

  # 2. Add open-researcher as remote
  git remote add open-researcher https://github.com/mendableai/open-researcher.git
  git fetch open-researcher

  # 3. Install additional dependencies
  npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk

  Phase 2: Core Integration

  1. Create new route: /app/research/page.tsx (avoid conflicts with existing chat)
  2. Add research components: Copy and adapt from open-researcher
  3. Integrate AI providers: Use your existing multi-provider setup with Claude for research
  4. Add research API: /app/api/research/route.ts

  Phase 3: UI Integration

  1. Add research nav item: Update components/navbar.tsx
  2. Create research dashboard: Integrate with existing user dashboard
  3. Style consistency: Ensure Tailwind classes match your theme

  Phase 4: Testing & Polish

  1. Test integration: Verify no conflicts with existing features
  2. Update documentation: Add research functionality to README
  3. Clean up: Remove unused dependencies

  Recommended PR Strategy

  - Small PRs: Break into 3-4 smaller PRs instead of one massive change
  - Feature flags: Add toggle to enable/disable research feature
  - Backward compatibility: Ensure existing functionality remains unchanged

  This approach minimizes risk while adding powerful research capabilities to your SaaS platform!
